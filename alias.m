function alias()
    %ALIAS Demonstrate the aliasing effect for discrete sinusoidal functions.
    %
    % This function plots two discrete sinusoidal functions y[n] = sin(2Ï€f n) 
    % for the frequencies f = 0.05 and f = 1.05. The purpose is to demonstrate 
    % the aliasing effect, where the higher frequency (f = 1.05) appears as if 
    % it's the lower frequency (f = 0.05) due to undersampling.
    %
    % The function generates a single plot with both sinusoidal functions 
    % overlapped. Different colors, line styles, and markers are used for each 
    % frequency to help distinguish between them.
    %
    % Example:

    %
    
    n = 0:49;  % 50 samples
    frequencies = [0.05, 1.05];
   
    % Plot the four functions overlapped on the same figure
